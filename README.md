**Tabpocalypse** is a browser extension that does what your friends won’t:

## 🔥 What It Does

- Detects when you have **too many tabs open**  
- Randomly delivers a **popup roast** or **desktop notification**  
- Injects roasts directly into webpages for max humiliation  
- Tracks your **peak tab count** and **total roasts received**  
- Lets you toggle **Mercy Mode** if you’re not emotionally prepared  
- Totally unnecessary. Absolutely essential.
